By participating in the Super Tester program for the Qibo app ("the Program"), you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these terms of service and use ("Terms") as well as our usual [Terms of Use](/tou). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not participate in the Program.

## Purpose of the Program

The Program is a paid subscription service provided by Unstatic Labs and its creators with no warranty of service (including availability, accuracy, or responsiveness). The Program allows Participants early access to Qibo app features and extended use of the app (beyond the usual free limits). Participants are billed monthly and may unsubscribe from the Program at any time.

The Program is designed to allow users to test and provide feedback on new features and updates to the Qibo app ("the App"). Participants in the Program are given access to exclusive test versions of the App and will be asked to provide feedback on their experience using the App. Their usage will be monitored and usage metrics will be shared with the developers to improve the Program. Participants must agree to the special privacy provisions outlined in these Terms, which supersede and replace our usual Privacy Policy.

## Eligibility for the Program

To be eligible for the Program, you must be at least 18 years of age and have a payment method enabled on the Google Play or Apple App store.

Participation in the Program is voluntary and subject to availability. We may or may not provide users with the opportunity to become Participants in the Program.

To participate in the Program, follow these steps:

1.  Install the "Test" version of the App from your usual App Store
2.  Wait for a pop-up message providing instructions on how to sign up for the Super Tester Program. Follow the instructions to subscribe.

## Privacy Policy

We are committed to protecting the privacy of Participants in the Program. By agreeing to these Terms, you acknowledge that you have read and agreed to our [full Privacy Policy](/privacy).

This section amends the latter with special provisions specific to the Super Tester Program.

### Information We Collect

We may collect personal information such as Device IDs, Unique User IDs, Store User IDs, Subscription IDs, and In-app Purchase IDs.

We may also collect anonymous data about the use of the test versions of the App, including feedback and comments provided by Participants.

This data is collected for the purpose of improving the App and providing a better experience for all users.

### How We Use and Share Your Information

We will not share any personal information that we collect from Participants in the Program with third parties, except as required by law.

Any anonymous data that we collect may be shared with third parties for the purpose of improving the App and providing a better experience for all users.

We may also request that you sign up for third party services on a voluntary basis to report bugs or provide detailed feedback. We will not require you to do so, but we reserve the right to revoke Super Tester subscriptions for Participants who do not provide sufficient useful or exploitable feedback.

## Limitation of Liability

We will not be liable for any damages or losses that may result from participation in the Program or the use of the test versions of the App. We will not be responsible for any harm or damage that may result from the use of the test versions of the App, including but not limited to any physical injury or damage to property.

## Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right to update and modify these Terms at any time.
