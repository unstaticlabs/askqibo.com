# Qibo, tell me why

Welcome! Qibo is a unique and innovative educational app that helps young children (ages 2-6) explore and learn about the world around them. With Qibo, children and their parents can get answers to any "Why?" questions in a fun and accessible way.

Qibo features a friendly and approachable character, who is able to provide accurate and appropriate answers to any questions asked. The app uses speech-to-text technology to process user questions and text-to-speech technology to provide spoken answers, and is integrated with an AI language model — based on Open AI's latest GPT3 advancements — to generate unique responses.
